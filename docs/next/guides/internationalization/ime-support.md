All the places in which a user can enter the data, for example input or textarea, support IME all the time. There is no need, nor ability, to enable or disable it. The additional editor will appear below the text editor if the right settings are set up in the Operating System.

### How to test if it works

You need to change your language preferences for your keyboard in your Operating System. Set up the input source as Korean, Japanese or Chinese and then start to edit any of the cell editors within Handsontable.

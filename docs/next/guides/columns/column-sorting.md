## Why and when it's been moved

This guide has been moved the Row Sorting page in May 2021. The reason is that we made a mistake when we first gave this plugin a name. In fact, what we do is comparing the values in rows and sorting them accordingly. Columns have nothing to do with it.

However, we may one day introduce a genuine column sorting feature. The one that changes the order of columns based on the values in the selected row.

# Building process

[[toc]]

## Overview

This guide provides detailed steps for building Handsontable and outlines the tasks that are available to be run.

## Introduction

The build process uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) as well as npm tasks listed in [package.json](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/blob/master/package.json). During this process, the source files located in the `src/*` directory are transformed into the output files:

* `./dist/handsontable.js`
* `./dist/handsontable.css`
* `./dist/handsontable.full.js`
* `./dist/handsontable.full.css`
* `./dist/handsontable.full.min.js`
* `./dist/handsontable.full.min.css`
* `./dist/languages/*`

More info about dist packages can be found [here](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/blob/master/dist/README.md). It is advised that you never modify the files mentioned above. Instead, make changes in the `src/` directory and then run a proper build. This is especially important if you want to contribute your changes back to Handsontable by making a pull request.

## npm tasks

Currently, the following tasks are available for building Handsontable:

* `npm run test` - runs several tasks in this order:
  * `npm run lint` - check if changes applied to the source code adhere to [our code style](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/blob/master/.eslintrc).
  * `npm run test:unit` - runs the test suite in node environment. It uses [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as a test runner.
  * `npm run test:types` - runs the tests which check if the code follows TypeScript definition.
  * `npm run test:walkontable` - runs a single build of Walkontable (the Handsontable renderer engine) followed by Jasmine test suite and executes in [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
  * `npm run test:e2e` - runs a single build of Handsontable followed by Jasmine test suite and by using the generated bundle `/dist/handsontable.js` executes it in [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
  * `npm run test:production` - runs a single build followed by Jasmine test suite and by using generated minified bundle `/dist/handsontable.full.min.js` executes it in [Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer).
* `npm run build` - runs a single build but without the code quality checking. It internally executes these tasks:
  * `npm run build:commonjs` - transpiles files into the `CommonJS` format. These files are published into NPM repository later.
  * `npm run build:es` - transpiles files into the `import/export` format. These files are published into NPM repository later.
  * `npm run build:umd` - creates the bundles (`dist/handsontable.js`, `dist/handsontable.css`, `dist/handsontable.full.js` and `dist/handsontable.full.css`) which are compatible with UMD (Universal Module Definition).
  * `npm run build:umd.min` - creates the minified bundles (`dist/handsontable.min.js`, `dist/handsontable.min.css`, `dist/handsontable.min.full.js` and `dist/handsontable.min.full.css`) which are compatible with UMD (Universal Module Definition).
  * `npm run build:languages` - creates the bundles containing language sets (i.e. `dist/languages/de-DE.js`, `dist/languages/all.js`) which are compatible with UMD (Universal Module Definition). More information about languages can be found [here](internationalization.md).
  * `npm run build:languages.min` - creates the minified bundles containing language sets (i.e. `dist/languages/de-DE.min.js`, `dist/languages/all.min.js`) which are compatible with UMD (Universal Module Definition). More information about languages can be found [here](internationalization.md).
* `npm run watch` - watches for changes in source directory and runs a build when a change is observed. For faster rebuild when a change is observed, the watcher triggers the file-building task without minify.

## Running your first build

To run your own build, follow the below steps:

1. Install Node.js (available for Windows, macOS, and Linux). This will also install NPM - Node Package Manager, which handles all the dependencies. Handsontable requires **Node.js >=15.11.0** and npm **>=7.1.1** for building and testing.
2. Clone the Handsontable repository on your local disk and go to the directory where you cloned it.
3. Run `npm install` to download all the dependencies defined in `package.json`. The dependencies will be downloaded into a new directory `node_modules`, which is ignored by Git.
4. **Run `npm run build` to make your first build!**

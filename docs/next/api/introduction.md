# Handsontable Reference

[[toc]]

**Our goal is to deliver the best developer experience and make it easy to dive in and start coding.**

However, data grids are rather complex libraries, so we assume that you possess a certain level of expertise in JavaScript before moving on. If you want to grab some basics, we have provided a JavaScript example in the [Hello Word](../hello-world/) section.

The API enables you to control the data grid programmatically. With this API, you can:

-   Configure options
-   Use methods to integrate it with your app
-   Use hooks to interact with what's happening in the grid
-   Introduce new integrations
-   and more

**This reference comprises four sections:**

### [Core](../api/core/)

The `Handsontable` class controls the essential aspects of the data grid.

### [Hooks](../api/hooks/)

Hooks are two-directional events that fire whenever a specific action occurs within the instance of Handsontable.

### [Options](../api/options/)

These are the settings available to be registered for the `Core` features, in addition to those provided by plugins.

### [Plugins](../api/plugins/)

The plugins extend the capabilities of Handsontable.

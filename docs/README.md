# Handsontable Documentation

For each project, the documentation is a significant place where the customers derive knowledge about how to use that tool.
That explains why it is worth to care about the experience of using the documentation.

This is nicer looking documentation with a great search engine.
It uses Markdown, which makes easy documentation maintenance for non-technical personnel.
Here we have a versioning tooling and automated deployment.
Thanks to all of that, creating and testing documentation becomes less time-consuming, and for our clients, it removes difficulties in using and searching the documentation.

# Roadmap

This roadmap highlights the major projects we think are crucial for both developers and end-users. 

Keep in mind, the business landscape changes fast, so we adjust the roadmap `every quarter` to keep things fresh and effective. Some projects might get the green light while others might not make the cut.

Curious about our progress? Check out the [Release Notes](@/guides/upgrade-and-migration/release-notes/release-notes.md) page.

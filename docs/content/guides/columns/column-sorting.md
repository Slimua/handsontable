## Why and when it's been moved

This guide has been moved to the Row Sorting page in May 2021. This is due to a naming error when we first named this plugin. We compare the values in **rows** and sort them accordingly. Columns have nothing to do with it.

At some point in the future, we may introduce a column sorting feature that would change the order of columns based on the values in the selected row.

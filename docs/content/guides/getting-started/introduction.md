## What is Handsontable?

Handsontable (pronounced "hands-on-table") is a JavaScript data grid component that provides the well-known look and feel of spreadsheet applications.

Thousands of business apps depend on Handsontable for entering, editing, validating, and cleansing data that comes from remote sources such as databases and APIs, or from HTML documents, Excel files, Google Sheets, and manual input.

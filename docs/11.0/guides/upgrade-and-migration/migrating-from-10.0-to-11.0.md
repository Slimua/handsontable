# Migrating from 10.0 to 11.0

[[toc]]

To upgrade your Handsontable version from 10.x.x to 11.x.x, follow this guide.

## Step 1: React, Angular, Vue â€“ register your modules

Starting with Handsontable 11.0.0, the [React wrapper](@/guides/integrate-with-react/react-installation.md), the [Angular wrapper](@/guides/integrate-with-angular/angular-installation.md), and the [Vue wrapper](@/guides/integrate-with-vue/vue-installation.md) support [modularization](@/guides/building-and-testing/modules.md).

If you don't use any of the wrappers, you don't need to change anything.

#### Using all modules

To continue using all Handsontable modules with your wrapper, register all modules with the new `registerAllModules()` method.

In the entry point file of your application, add the following code:
```js
// import the registerAllModules() method
import { registerAllModules } from 'handsontable/registry';

// register all Handsontable modules
registerAllModules();
```

#### Using individual modules

To start using individual Handsontable modules with your wrapper, see the following guides:
- [Using modules with React](@/guides/integrate-with-react/react-modules.md)
- [Using modules with Angular](@/guides/integrate-with-angular/angular-modules.md)
- [Using modules with Vue](@/guides/integrate-with-vue/vue-modules.md)

## Step 2: Adapt to the TypeScript definitions file changes

Before, all of Handsontable's TypeScript definitions were kept in one huge file, placed in the root directory: `./handsontable.d.ts`.

Now, each module has its own TypeScript definitions file. They're all kept in a new `types` directory: [`./handsontable/types`](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/tree/master/handsontable/types).

For more details, see [this pull request](https://github.com/handsontable/handsontable/pull/8875).

## Step 3: Adapt to the `populateFromArray()` method's changes

The [`populateFromArray()`](@/api/core.md#populatefromarray) method works differently now, when its `method` argument is set to `shift_down` or `shift_right`.

#### Before

- [`populateFromArray()`](@/api/core.md#populatefromarray) performed a separate `spliceRow` action for each populated row, and a separate `spliceColumn` action for each populated column.
- The [`beforeChange`](@/api/hooks.md#beforechange) and [`afterChange`](@/api/hooks.md#afterchange) hooks were triggered multiple times, separately for each populated row and column.
- The [`beforeChange`](@/api/hooks.md#beforechange) and [`afterChange`](@/api/hooks.md#afterchange) hooks were triggered by each `spliceRow` and `spliceColumn` action, with the `source` argument defined as `spliceRow` or `spliceCol`.

```js
new Handsontable(element, {
  afterChange: (changes, source) => {
    if (source === 'spliceRow' || source === 'spliceCol') {
      handleChange(changes[0]);
    }
  }
});
```

#### Now

- [`populateFromArray()`](@/api/core.md#populatefromarray) populates rows and columns with one large operation.
- The [`beforeChange`](@/api/hooks.md#beforechange) and [`afterChange`](@/api/hooks.md#afterchange) hooks are triggered only once, for all populated rows and columns.
- The [`beforeChange`](@/api/hooks.md#beforechange) and [`afterChange`](@/api/hooks.md#afterchange) hooks are triggered directly by the [`populateFromArray()`](@/api/core.md#populatefromarray) method, with the `source` argument defined as `populateFromArray`.

```js
new Handsontable(element, {
  afterChange: (changes, source) => {
    if (source === 'populateFromArray') {
      changes.forEach(change =>  handleChange(change))
    }
  }
});
```
